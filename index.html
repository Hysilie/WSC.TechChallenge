        Colchis, ancient region at the eastern end of the Black Sea south of the
        Caucasus, in the western part of modern Georgia. It consisted of the
        valley of the Phasis (modern Rioni) River. In Greek mythology, Colchis
        was the home of Medea and the destination of the Argonauts, a land of
        fabulous wealth and the domain of sorcery.

          The advanced economy and favorable geographic and natural conditions
          of the area attracted the Milesian Greeks who colonized the Colchian
          coast establishing here their trading posts at Phasis, Gyenos, and
          Dioscurias in the 6th-5th centuries BC.
        </p>

          It was considered <i>"the farthest voyage"</i> according to an ancient
          Greek proverbial expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the
          Argonauts, as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece.<br />
          It was also described as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey
          that would export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic
          city-states.

      <h2>About Greek Mythology</h2>
      <p>
        Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient
        Greeks, and a genre of <b>Ancient Greek folklore</b>. These stories
        concern the origin and nature of the world, the lives and activities of
        deities, heroes, and mythological creatures, and the origins and
        significance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and ritual practices.
        Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and
        political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the
        nature of myth-making itself.<br />

        The Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition
        most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th century
        BC eventually the myths of the heroes of the <b>Trojan War</b> and its
        aftermath became part of the oral tradition of Homer's epic poems,
        <i>the Iliad and the Odyssey</i>. <br />Two poems by Homer's near
        contemporary Hesiod, the Theogony and the Works and Days, contain
        accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers,
        the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin
        of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns,
        in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, in the
        works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC, in
        writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age, and in texts from
        the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and
        Pausanias.<br />

        Aside from this narrative deposit in ancient Greek literature, pictorial
        representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes featured
        prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts
        and many other artifacts. Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth
        century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures
        of Heracles. In the succeeding <b>Archaic</b>, <b>Classical</b>, and
        <b>Hellenistic</b> periods, Homeric and various other mythological
        scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.<br />

        Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and
        literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage
        and language. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have
        derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered
        contemporary significance and relevance in the themes.
